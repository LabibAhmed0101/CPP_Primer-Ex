Exercise 4.14: 
Explain what happens in each of the if tests:

if (42 = i) // ...
illegal , because we can't use integral literals as lvalue it only can be used as rvalue.

if (i = 42) // ...
since condition assign 42 to i , then i have a nonzero value then the condition will
be evaluated as true .
