Exercise 4.35: 
Given the following definitions, 

char cval; int ival; unsigned int ui;
float fval; double dval;

identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:

(a) cval = 'a' + 3;
 a will be promoted to int then add 3 to it then convert that int value to char

(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;

note:
The default type for floating-point literals is double. Floating-point literals of type float or 
long double can be specified by adding one of the following suffixes:

Suffix	Type
f or F	float
l or L	long double

For example:
3.14159	   // double
3.14159L   // long double
6.02e23f   // float  

1st ival will be converted to double type then multiply it by 1.0
then ui will be converted to double and subtract the result of ival * 1.0 from it
then the final result will be converted to float by truncation and assigened to fval

(c) dval = ui * fval;
1st ui will be converted to float type then multiplyed by fval and the result
will be converted to double type and assigened to dval


(d) cval = ival + fval + dval;
ival will be converted to float type then added to fval and the result will be converted
to double type then added to dval then the result will be converted to char type then 
assigned to cval
