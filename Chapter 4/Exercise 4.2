Exercise 4.2:

Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to indicate the order in 
which the operands are grouped:

(a) * vec.begin()
	* ( vec.begin() )
	
(b) * vec.begin() + 1
	
	( * ( vec.begin() ) ) + 1
	1- vec.begin() will be evaluated and we get a pointer to the begining of the vector vec.
	2-derfrence the pointer  to get the value of the 1st element in vec .
	3- then add 1 to the value of the 1st element in vec.
