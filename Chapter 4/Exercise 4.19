Exercise 4.19: 
Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a vector<int>, and that ival 
is an int, explain the behavior of each of these expressions. Which, if 
any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected?

(a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++
if ptr is not null pointer and the derefrenced value of ptr is nonzero then
this expression is evaluated as true.

Although in the past expression ptr is used twice in the same expression but
the logical AND (&&) operator guarantee that its left-hand operand is evaluated 
first. Moreover, we are also guaranteed that the right-hand operand is evaluated 
only if the left-hand operand is true.

(b) ival++ && ival
checks if ival have nonzero value if true  then check ival+1 have nonezero value

(c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]
The problem is that  both the left and right-hand operands to <= use ival and 
the left-hand operand changes ival so it is undefined behavior becuaese we 
have an unsequenced modification and access of a memory location

the right way to do it would be like

if(vec[ival] <= vec[ival + 1])			// used ival without changeing its value
{
//code
ival++ ;					//increament of ival by 1
}
