Exercise 4.16: 
Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer 
expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.

(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
assigenment operator (=) got low precedence so getPtr() != 0 will be evaluated 1st
which is not intended to fix it it should be like
if ((p = getPtr()) != 0)

(b) if (i = 1024)
this if condition will be always true cuz wer are assigning (not comparing) 1024 to i which is a none-zero value
to fix it it should be :
if(i == 1024)
this condition will be only true of i = 1024
