Exercise 4.3:

Exercise 4.3: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left
undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy
presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in
the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an
acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

Yes becuase one of the most significant reasons to use c++ is the optimization so code run faster.
And those who use c++ should be aware of such tricky situtions and always keep it in mind while writing thier code.
