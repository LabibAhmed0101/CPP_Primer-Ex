Exercise 4.29: 
Predict the output of the following code and explain your reasoning. Now run the 
program. Is the output what you expected? If not, figure out why.

int x[10]; int *p = x;
cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl;
cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl;

sizeof(x) returns the number of the bytes that the entire array x is taking in the memory which is 40 bytes
sizeof(*x) returns the number of bytes that the 1st element in x array taking in the memory which is 4 bytes
because its type is int

sizeof(p) returns the size needed to hold a pointer to integer which is 8 bytes
sizeof(*p) returns the size of the type of the object which p points to which is 4 bytes

output will be :
10	
2
