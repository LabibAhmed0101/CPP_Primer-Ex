Exercise 4.30: 
Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to match the 
default evaluation:

(a) sizeof x + y
(sizeof(x)) + y		//sizeof operator got a higher precedence than the binary +

(b) sizeof p->mem[i]
sizeof (p->mem[i])	//member selector(->) got higher precedence than size of operator


(c) sizeof a < b
(sizeof(a)) < b		//sizeof operator got higher precedence than the less than operator (<) 

(d) sizeof f()
sizeof(f())		//function call operator( () ) got higher precedence than sizeof operator
			//and it will return the size of the type returned from the function call
			//unless the function return type is void (returns nothing)
