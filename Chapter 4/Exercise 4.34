Exercise 4.34: 
Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in 
the following expressions:

(a) if (fval)
fval will be converted to bool , and if fval is a none-zero value the condition
will be true , and if fval value is 0 the condition will be false

(b) dval = fval + ival;
1st ival will be converted to float type then added to fval.
then the result of the sum will be converted from float type to double type

(c) dval + ival * cval;
1st cval will be promoted to int  then multiply it by ival
then the result of ival * cval will beconverted to double and finally added to dval
