Exercise 4.12: 
Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k means.

since < got precedence on != so j < k will be evaluted 1st.

i != (j < k)

if j < k is true 

then if i not equal to 1 (true) the whole expression will be true

if j < k is false

then if i not equal to 0 (false) the whole expression will be true


in that expression i != j < k 

tho i, j and k are integers but that expression only compared j and k as integers
then generated a bool value for them either true (1) or false (0).

then i will be compared to 
if j < k is true means i != true (1) 
if j < k is false means i != false (0)

It is usually a bad idea to use the boolean literals true and false as operands in a comparison. 
These literals should be used only to compare to an object of type bool.
