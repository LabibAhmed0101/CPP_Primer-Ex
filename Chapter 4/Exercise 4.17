Exercise 4.17: 
Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

int a = 0;
int b ;

b = ++a;		//prefix
in the case of prefix the value of a and b will be :
a = 1 , b = 1
The prefix operators return the object itself as an lvalue.

b = a++;		//postfix
in the case of Postfix the value of a and b will be :
a = 1 , b = 0
cuz postfix will keep a copy of a (0) to assign to b then increase a by 1
The postfix operators return a copy of the objectâ€™s original value as an rvalue.
