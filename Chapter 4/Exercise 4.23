Exercise 4.23: 
The following expression fails to compile due to operator
precedence. Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you
fix it?

string s = "word";
string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ;

it fails because add operator (+) got higher precedence than conditional operator (?:)
to fix it the conditional should be parenthesized :

string pl = s + ( s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ) ;

parentheses guarantee the conditional expression will be evaluted 1st then will be added to s .
