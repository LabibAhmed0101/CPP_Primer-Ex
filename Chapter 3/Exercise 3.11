Exercise 3.11: 
Is the following range for legal? If so, what is the type of c?

const string s = "Keep out!";
for (auto &c : s) { /* ... */ }

Range for can be legal and illegal depends on what will be written inside it.
It will be illegal incase the code inside the { } will change the value of  the string like :

c = 'y' ;

Since s is defined as a constant string so it can't be modified or changed.

If the code won't change the value of the s so it will be legal to use it like :

cout << c ;

This code will write the value of c without changing its value. so its legal.


Type of c here will be const char & .
