/*Exercise 3.29: 
List some of the drawbacks of using an array instead of a vector.

Arrays are not flexiable because they have a fixed size  and we cannot add elements to an array .
You can not use arrays if you don't know exactly how many elements you need.

unlike vectors arrays can't be assinged  or copied to another array.*/
