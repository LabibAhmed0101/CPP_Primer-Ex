Exercise 3.26: In the binary search program on page 112, why did we write mid = beg + (end - beg) / 2; 
instead of mid = (beg + end)/2; ?

mid = beg + (end - beg) /2
is the right one to use becuase by using difference  between two iterators it gives us the distance between them.

(end - beg)
will have a result as an integer number and then will be divided by 2 , then the integer which will be evaluated
will be added to beg.

but
mid = (beg + end) /2;
its syntax is not right because iterator can't be added to another iterator.
iterator of vectors and strings can be added to integers but not to another iterator.

iterators can be subtracted to give a distance, but not added together.
