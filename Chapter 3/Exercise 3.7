Exercise 3.7: 
What would happen if you define the loop control variable in the previous exercise 
as type char? Predict the results and then change your program to use a char to 
see if you were right.

Nothing changes the only difference is  auto let the compiler to determine the type
of the loop control variable .
auto in that case yields char type.
